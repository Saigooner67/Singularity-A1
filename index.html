      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This website is part of my school computer project about how satellites help us
        study our planet. Using satellite imagery and physics principles,
        scientists can measure things like vegetation health, water levels,
        and land changes over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this project is to learn how space technology and computer
        science work together to observe and protect Earth.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Space-based observation plays a key role in understanding climate change,
        deforestation, and the health of our planet. Projects like this one
        help build awareness of how technology can be used for good.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        In future updates, this site will include example satellite images,
        NDVI calculations, and simple data visualizations created with Python
        or web tools.
